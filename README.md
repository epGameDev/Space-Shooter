#### Description

This game was created in the Unity game engine and was a project intro into C# and Unity. We started with a prototype and moved into replacing all primitive objects with actual game assets from [GameDevHQ](https://filebase.gamedevhq.com/ "Filebase"). After this and a few more tutoraials on how to work with the basics of unity and C#, we were set to go on our own path to interpret the direction of the game. That is why in most student projects, there are many different outcomes and styles.

This game is hosted on REPL.it for now until I can added it to my other site that is currently being built. 

If you want to read more into the development, I have articles on [Medium](https://medium.com/@ericpdev "Medium.com") on how it was produced.
